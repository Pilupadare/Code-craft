# HTML & CSS Homework – Challenge Mode

##  Exercise 1: Profile Card Grid
- Created a responsive `.team` section with profile cards for Kalkidan, Abebe, and Solomon.
- Each card includes an image, name, job title, and social media list.
- CSS selectors used: element, class, ID, descendant, child, and attribute (`a[href^="mailto"]`)
- Added hover effects and a decorative badge with `::before`

## ✅ Exercise 2: Pricing Table
- Built a 3-column pricing table using the box model
- Used `box-sizing: content-box` for Basic and `border-box` for Popular and Pro
- Styled with borders, shadows, border-radius, and spacing via `margin` and `gap`
- Badge for "Most Popular" with positioning + `::before`
- Bonus: tooltip-like effect on hover

## Exercise 3: Hero Section
- Structured a responsive hero using `flex` layout
- Sticky navigation bar with display variations (inline, block, inline-block)
- `hero-bg` image layered behind using `position: absolute` and `z-index: -1`
- Media query at `max-width: 768px` stacks layout vertically on mobile

###  Reflections
This homework helped me practice complex selectors, understand how CSS box model affects layout, and experiment with positioning and responsive design. I now feel more confident building multi-section websites with clean structure and interactive styling!
